# 📤 Manual GitHub Upload Guide

Since Git commands aren't available in this environment, we'll upload the files manually through GitHub's web interface.

## Step 1: Download Project Files

First, we need to get all the project files. Here's what you need to do:

### Option A: Download Individual Files (Recommended)
1. **Right-click on each file** in the file explorer on the left
2. **Select "Download"** for each file
3. **Create the same folder structure** on your computer

### Option B: Copy File Contents
For each file, you can:
1. **Click on the file** in the file explorer
2. **Select all content** (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
3. **Copy the content** (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
4. **Create the file locally** and paste the content

## Step 2: Upload to GitHub

### 2.1 Navigate to Your Repository
- Go to your GitHub repository page
- You should see an empty repository with setup instructions

### 2.2 Upload Files via Web Interface

**Method 1: Drag and Drop (Easiest)**
1. Click **"uploading an existing file"** link on the repository page
2. **Drag and drop all your project files** into the upload area
3. **Add commit message**: "Initial commit: Interschool Travel CRM"
4. Click **"Commit changes"**

**Method 2: Create Files Manually**
1. Click **"Create new file"** button
2. **Type the filename** (including folder path, e.g., `src/App.tsx`)
3. **Paste the file content**
4. Click **"Commit new file"**
5. **Repeat for each file**

## Step 3: Verify Upload
After uploading, your repository should contain:
```
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── contexts/
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── types/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── main.tsx
│   └── index.css
├── supabase/
│   └── migrations/
├── public/
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md
└── other config files
```

## Step 4: Ready for Next Step
Once your files are uploaded to GitHub, we can proceed with:
- ✅ GitHub Repository (Complete)
- 🔄 Supabase Setup (Next)
- ⏳ Netlify Deployment (Final)
